<p>More importantly, the victory took us back to the summit of the Premier League, after 13 games played, and increased the lead over Chelsea to 13 points.</p>

<p style="margin-top:45px;">“It’s another step forward,” the boss said at the final whistle. “To prove ourselves that we can do it, that we can play at that level against these sorts of players and teams, And Hopefully they will have more belief.</p>

<p>“I think we are a really young team but today we played like a mature team, we use the right words. Composure, it’s determination, it’s quality, it’s courage to do it in these scenarios, and that’s the steps we have to take as a team, and today we have taken that step.”</p>
