    <h2>Gabriel said - "We were One team"</h2>
    <p>It was a start full of intensity from the visitors, Ben White had our first two sighters on goal – the first blazed over, the second dragged just wide.</p>

    <p>Gabriel Martinelli was next to try his luck, shooting over from the edge of the area. Gabriel Jesus had a shot charged down when he burst into the box, weaved past two defenders but Thiago Silva slid in to block.</p>

    <p>Our best move of the half resulted in an opportunity for Jesus. He couldn’t stretch quite enough to get his head on the end of a Martinelli cross though. He had beaten the offside trap to find the space, but maybe just checked his run at the vital moment.</p>
