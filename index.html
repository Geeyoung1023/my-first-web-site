    <h2>Welcome to Gooners!</h2>
    Now an ever-present in our continental campaign, the American shot-stopper will once again be itching to walk out in his new home against PSV Eindhoven in a crunch game that will go a long way to deciding who tops the group.

    “Any time you get to step out onto the field is a real treat,” he said. “You work really hard during the week, and to get opportunities to play - and for me personally to show how much I’ve grown as a player and a goalkeeper - is really nice. Obviously, playing for this great club is an honour, and something I don’t take for granted. It’s been really, really great.”
